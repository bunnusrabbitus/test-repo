##General Protocol for Ribopuromycylation (Reovirus)

####Abbreviations:
* RPM = ribopuromycylation
* MOI = multiplicity of infection
* mM = millimolar
* µM = micromolar
* DMEM = Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium
* x3 = three times
* FBS = fetal bovine serum
* DAPI = 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
* PBS = phosphate-buffered saline
* PBS<sup>+</sup> = phosphate-buffered saline _plus_ 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>

####Protocol:

1.	**Day Before Infection**
  *	Prepare a 24 well plate containing 15mm glass coverslips at a cell density that gives rise to about 60% confluency the next day. 

2.	**Infection**
  * In general, for the examination of translational proteins during infection I infect with a MOI of 1 so that I can capture both infected and uninfected within the same image.

  1.	 Ensure that cells are no more than 70% confluent.
  2.	 Place your virus on ice.
  3.	 Aspirate media from each well and rinse one time with PBS containing 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (PBS<sup>+</sup>). 
  4.	 To a 24 well plate add 150 µl (total volume) PBS+ containing virus. Incubate virus-infected cells at RT for 1 h with rocking every 10 minutes.
  5.	 At the end of infection, aspirate virus and rinse once with PBS<sup>+</sup>. Add 500 µl of warmed media. Place cells in incubator at 37°C for desired time.

3.	**Ribopuromycylation with co-extract fix (to localize active translation using Puromycin)**

  1. 	Pre-warm RPM media (DMEM containing 7.5% FBS supplemented with 182 µM Puromycin and 208 µM emetine) and DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FBS.
  2. 	Aspirate media and wash once with warm DMEM/7.5% FBS.
  3. 	Pre-treat cells with 208 µM emetine for 15 minutes at 37°C
  4. 	Aspirate and wash x 3 with warm DMEM/7.5% FBS.
  5. 	Add warmed RPM media to coverslips for 5 minutes at 37°C
  6. 	Immediately place plate on ice.
  7. 	Wash cells x 2 with ice cold PBS.
  8. 	Fix and extract cells with polysome buffer (300 µl) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM KCl, 355 μM cycloheximide, EDTA-free protease inhibitors, and 10 U/ml RNaseOut) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Incubate cells on ice for 20 minutes.
  9. 	Wash x 3 with PBS.
  10. 	Incubate coverslips with staining buffer (SB, 0.05% saponin, 10 mM glycine, 5% FBS, and PBS) for 15 min at RT.
  11. 	Aspirate SB and incubate coverslips with primary antibody (anti-puromycin, clone 2A4, 1:4000. http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/puromycin) diluted in SB for 1 h at RT on rocker (slowest speed).
  12. 	Aspirate primary antibody and wash coverslips X 1 with PBS.
  13. 	Incubate coverslips with secondary antibody diluted in SB for 1 h on rocker protected from light.
  14. 	Aspirate secondary and wash coverslips X 3 with PBS, leaving in last wash
  15. 	Mount coverslips to glass slides with Prolong gold anti-fade reagent + DAPI (6 µl for a 15mm coverslip). Allow coverslips to cure overnight before imaging. Store slides in dark.
