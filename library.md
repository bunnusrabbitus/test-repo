#Ribo-seq Library Preparation

###General notes:
1. Elution buffer: make the components yourself. Saisa has EDTA, which is stored in the fridge (#50 lower right corner)
2. Polysome buffer: use the components that Saisai has to prepare this buffer
3. Commercial RNase-free water is on Saisai's bench
  * Aliquot in 50 ml tubes before using.
4. Reagents for Riboseq are stored in a box in the 4ºC fridge #50 (bottom left corner)
5. Use the 'special' batch of A549 cells from LN2 (which one? Saisai)
6. Infected cells should be 80-90% confluent at the time of collection
7. Use 2 x 10 ml plate for each timepoint
8. Use new CHX for the lysis buffer
9. Use the old CHX powder in the 4ºC for PBS and sucrose
10. Prepare 60% sucrose stock
  * use this stock to prepare the 45%, 15%, and 1M sucrose solutions.

###Protocol:
** DAY 1**
1. Wash cells twice with ice cold PBS + CHX
  * Use a 1/1000 dilution of the stock CHX solution
2. Tilt the dishes in the ice and remove the PBS + CHX
3. Add 400 µl of lysis buffer to the first plate
  * Lysis buffer is stored in -20ºC freezer (#53)
  * Need 400 µl of lysis buffer for each time point (see step 5)
  * Polysome buffer, 2% triton, CHX (1/500)
  * 100 µg/ml stock solutino of CHX is stored at 4ºC
4. Scrape the cells
5. Transfer the lysate to a second plate with same collection time. Scrape cells again.
6. Transfer lysate to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube on ice.
7. Incubate on ice for 15 min.
8. Store samples at -80ºC until ready.

**DAY 2**
1. Thaw samples on ice.
2. Transfer 100 µl of lysate from each timepoint to a separate Eppendorf for RNAseq
  *  Keep on ice.
3. Centrifuge lysate for Riboseq at 13,000 rpm in microcentrifuge at 4ºC, 10 min.
4. Transfer supernatant to new Eppendorf and discard pellet.
5. Add RNaseI 4 µl per plate or 8 µl per tube in this case, to the lysate.
  * RNaseI is stored in the -20ºC freezer.
6. Incubate with RNAseI in the cold room on a rotator for 1 hr (attach with tape).
7. Add 4 volumes of Trizol LS reagent to RNAseq aliquots (Total volume should be 500 µl)
  * Trizol is stored in the flammable closet beneath the chimical hood.
8. Incubate for 5 min at RT then transfer to -80ºC freezer.
9. Remove Riboseq samples from the rotator, place on ice and add 4 µl of SUPERase In to each sample.
10. Proceed to sucrose gradient protocol.
