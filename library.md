#Ribo-seq Library Preparation

###General notes:
1. Elution buffer: make the components yourself. Saisa has EDTA, which is stored in the fridge (#50 lower right corner)
2. Polysome buffer: use the components that Saisai has to prepare this buffer
3. Commercial RNase-free water is on Saisai's bench
  * Aliquot in 50 ml tubes before using.
4. Reagents for Riboseq are stored in a box in the 4ºC fridge #50 (bottom left corner)
5. Use the 'special' batch of A549 cells from LN2 (which one? Saisai)
6. Infected cells should be 80-90% confluent at the time of collection
7. Use 2 x 10 ml plate for each timepoint
8. Use new CHX for the lysis buffer
9. Use the old CHX powder in the 4ºC for PBS and sucrose
10. Prepare 60% sucrose stock
  * use this stock to prepare the 45%, 15%, and 1M sucrose solutions.
