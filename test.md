##General Protocol for Ribopuromycylation (Reovirus)


1.	**Day Before Infection**
  *	Prepare a 24 well plate containing 15mm glass coverslips at a cell density that gives rise to about 60% confluency the next day. 

2.	Infection
In general, for the examination of translational proteins during infection I infect with a MOI of 1 so that I can capture both infected and uninfected within the same image.

  *	Ensure that cells are no more than 70% confluent.
  *	Place your virus on ice.
  *	Aspirate media from each well and rinse one time with PBS containing 2 mM MgCl2 (PBS+). 
  *	To a 24 well plate add 150ul (t.v.) PBS+ containing virus. Incubate virus-infected cells at RT for 1 h with rocking every 10 minutes.
  *	At the end of infection, aspirate virus and rinse X1 with PBS+. Add 500ul of warmed media. Place cells in incubator at 37°C for desired time.

3.	Ribopuromycylation with co-extract fix (to localize active translation using Puromycin)

  *	Pre-warm RPM media (DMEM containing 7.5% FBS supplemented with 182 uM Puromycin and 208 uM emetine) and DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FBS.
  *	Aspirate media and wash X 1 with warm DMEM/7.5% FBS.
  *	Pre-treat cells with 208 µM emetine for 15 minutes at 37°C
  *	Aspirate and wash X 3 with warm DMEM/7.5% FBS.
  *	Add warmed RPM media to coverslips for 5 minutes at 37°C
  *	Immediately place plate on ice.
  *	Wash cells X 2 with ice cold PBS.
  *	Fix and extract cells with polysome buffer (300ul) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 355 μM cycloheximide, EDTA-free protease inhibitors, and 10 U/ml RNaseOut) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Incubate cells on ice for 20 minutes.
  *	Wash X 3 with PBS.
  *	Incubate coverslips with staining buffer (SB, 0.05% saponin, 10 mM glycine, 5% FBS, and PBS) for 15 min at RT.
  *	Aspirate SB and incubate coverslips with primary antibody (anti-puromycin, clone 2A4, 1:4000. http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/puromycin) diluted in SB for 1 h at RT on rocker (slowest speed).
  *	Aspirate primary antibody and wash coverslips X 1 with PBS.
  *	Incubate coverslips with secondary antibody diluted in SB for 1 h on rocker protected from light.
  *	Aspirate secondary and wash coverslips X 3 with PBS, leaving in last wash
  *	Mount coverslips to glass slides with Prolong gold anti-fade reagent + dapi (6ul for a 15mm coverslip). Allow coverslips to cure overnight before imaging. Store slides in dark.
